As we know in end of the day React is compiled to HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT our browser undestands only HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
Browser Does not understand React

where to use React?
=> it is used where there is a complex front-end it means on 1 click 3 to 4 paces is going to be update

why React was created?
=> Example Analogy
Old Way:
        Imagine a wall with 100 tiles. If one tile is dirty, 
        you: Repaint the entire wall (all 100 tiles), even though only one tile needs cleaning.


New Way (React):
                If one tile is dirty,
                you: Clean just that one tile, leaving the other 99 untouched.

Conclusion => With React, the cart updates faster and with less work for the developer because React:
              Figures out what exactly changed (like adding an item).
              Updates only that small part of the page.


difference between FRAMEWORK & LIBRARY
=> FRAMEWORK: Think of a framework like a strict, regimented school with a set curriculum and rules. 
              It dictates how students should learn and behave.
              Examples: Angular, Django, Ruby on Rails.

   LIBRARY: Imagine a library as a helpful, flexible tutor. It gives you tools and functions that
            you can use whenever and however you want.
            Examples: React, jQuery, Lodash.


How React Does This:
=> Virtual DOM: React doesnâ€™t update the entire page directly. It creates a copy of the page (called the "virtual DOM"), 
                figures out the exact change needed, and updates only that part of the real page. This makes things much faster.

=> Components: React splits the webpage into small, reusable pieces called "components." Each component manages 
               its own behavior, making the code easier to write and understand.

In whole Documentation of react they have not mentioned that about create-react-app utility.
but this utility is famous and Bulky becoz it has unnessecary package that we donot use.
=> npx create-react-app 01_basicreact

the entry point for any code is package.json in which each and every detail is given
it is recommended to use npm run in start. But why ? reason unknown


as we know craete-react-app is Bulky that is why it is recommended to use VITE and PARCEL these are also a utility
